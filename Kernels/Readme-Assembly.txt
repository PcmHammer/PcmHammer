How to build the Assembly Kernels

To build an Assembly Kernel.
Build.cmd -x -aFF8000 -pP01
Will build the P01 Kernel for loading at address FF8000 and not copy it anywhere, Clean.cmd will remove it ...
The dash x tells the build system to build the assembly version.

To build a Loader and Kernel
Build.cmd -x -aFF9090 -lFF9890 -pP04
Will build the P04 Loader and Kernel.

If you want Build.cmd to copy the Kernel someplace
Build.cmd -x -c -tC:\Directory\Where\You\Want\It -aFF8000 -pP01

See Build.cmd -h for help and or other options ...
